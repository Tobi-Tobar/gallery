  <h1 style="background-color:white;">Artist Statement</h1>

	<p>We are all made of the same Earth. Water, grime, flesh, blood. Nothing separates the me that exists in you. Whatever you think you feel in the current notion, is a lie; I reveal and seduce your true feelings through my visions, and manipulate your soggy, pink mass of fat that sits armored on your pillared body towards the demons that torment my own little world. Cookie cut perfection, a line straighter that a heterosexual, isn’t that fun? Feed yourself, lose some weight, come out of the closet, be a proper woman, relax, study harder, have a social life, build walls around you to the point they become physical and trap you in your own illusion of your room. What am I doing wrong? I quake at the smallest error, I freeze at the sight of them, why do I suffer every single moment that I am aware. Zone in, zone out, zone in, zone out, mask it all, mask it all so no one notices. I showed you my fears, I became vulnerable to you, a stranger who meandered into my realm. Accept my woes, and drink air by the mouthfuls, once you take a step, you will suffocate in my shoes.

  <h1 style="background-color:white;">Biography</h1>

<p style="background-color:white;">	I started drawing and creating characters in highschool (from around 2012-2016). I never thought of it as a career until I entered community college at the ripe ol’ age of 18, where I got to learn the fundamentals of art from figure drawing, color theory, to some animation. I originally wanted to be an animator, though standards in my University said I wasn’t smart enough to make it in the animation course, but I settled for Digital Media Art. Although I have been making art my entire life, I started taking it seriously around 2019, where I created my first finished piece called Flow Universal (2019). This piece came to me in a dream, a rather vivid dream and was able to capture the essence of that dream into the character, Flow. I think from that moment, I wanted to create art that came to me in my most vividness, not only through dreams, but from my overwhelmed emotions; My highest peaks of mixed emotions that tend to be hidden from the world. I want people to see my deranged emotions, running wild, rabid, and overall unfiltered. I know people would feel ashamed if they showed their true feelings, so I’m giving them their freedom to see how I dealt with them. With my art. My semi-latest piece series Their World, not yours (2020) Is one of the pieces I’m most proud of. It shows my struggle with being a closeted trans person, and therapy isn’t cheap (nor is art), but I think being able to show my own reflection of how I truly see myself and how I came to accept my current being was through making this piece. And I’m hoping people can find comfort and acceptance on their own accord.
